The Web Stream Dev software and hardware is [Open Source](https://github.com/webstream). 
While many members of the community work hard to improve and maintain the software, 
ultimately the boring day to day work needed to keep webstream working well is done by our [team](https://team.webstream.dev). 
We do not work full time on Web Stream Dev and we supported purely by [webstream project](https://www.webstream.dev) and donations.

Web Stream Dev runs on all the plartforms below and many more besides, completely free of charge.
